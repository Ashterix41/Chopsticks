# Chopsticks
An elementary attempt to create the combinatorial game 'Chopsticks'. This is a first step towards creating a more immersive game experience that involves all the variations of the game regularly played in real life such as hand-swapping, hand-transfer. splitting, etc. 

This guided project is built with generous help from the internet on the 2nd month of my coding journey.
